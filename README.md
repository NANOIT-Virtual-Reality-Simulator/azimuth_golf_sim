# Azimuth Golf Simulator
- Azimuth: A golf simulator built upon advanced machine learning and deep learning models
- A group project by: Prakhar Agrawal, Eddie Owens, Xiao Han, Jenny Kong, Xinke Sun, Zhe Yuan

Model training code has not been included in this repository. In case it is added in the future, a link to the same will be added here.

## How it works:

![How It works](/images/how_it_works.png)

You take a video of yourself, hitting a golf ball into a net, and upload it to our website. We analyze the video, and give you results like these:

![Sample Results](/images/sample_result.png)

You get an estimate of your shot's **Carry**, **Offline** and **Total Distance**, in addition to getting one for *Ball Speed*, *Launch Angle*, *Azimuth* and *Side Spin* and *Back Spin*.

Not only that, you get to see your shot's trajectory and to play aroud with it (i.e., zoom, rotate, play and pause etc.)

You can also enter contests like the one below, and compete with your friends or with total strangers to see who gets to the top of the leaderboard:
