- Azimuth: A golf simulator built upon advanced machine learning and deep learning models
- A group project by:

## How it works:

![How It works](/images/how_it_works.png)

You take a video of yourself, hitting a golf ball into a net, and upload it to our website. We analyze the video, and give you results like these:

![Sample Results](/images/sample_result.png)

You get an estimate of your shot's carry, offline and total distance, in addition to getting one for ball speed, launch angle, azimuth and side and back spin.

Not only that, you get to see your shot's trajectory and to play aroud with it (i.e., zoom, rotate, play and pause etc.)

You can also enter contests like the one below, and compete with your friends or with total strangers to see who gets to the top of the leaderboard:
